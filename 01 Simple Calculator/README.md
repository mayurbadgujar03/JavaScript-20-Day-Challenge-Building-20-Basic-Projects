01 Simple Calculator
This is a simple JavaScript calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes input validation to ensure that users input valid numbers.

Features
Basic Operations: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Keyboard Support: You can trigger operations using keyboard keys (+, -, *, /).
Input Validation: Invalid inputs trigger a warning message and shake animation.
Clear Button: Clears all inputs and results.
Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes.
Getting Started
Clone the Repository:
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
```git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-calculator.git```
Open the Project:
Navigate to the project directory and open the index.html file in your web browser.

Usage:

Enter two numbers into the input fields.
Click on the operation buttons or use the keyboard keys (+, -, *, /) to perform the corresponding calculation.
The result will be displayed below the input fields.
If you enter an invalid input, an error message will show, and the calculator will shake.
Click the clear button to reset the calculator.
Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the calculator layout.
CSS: For styling the calculator and animations.
JavaScript: For the logic behind the calculations and interactivity.
Code Explanation
Here’s how the logic works:

Selectors: We start by selecting all the HTML elements that we'll need for the calculator (inputs, buttons, result display, etc.).
Event Listeners: Event listeners are attached to each button (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and the clear button. When clicked, they call the appropriate function to perform the operation.
Keyboard Support: We also add event listeners for key presses, so users can perform calculations using the keyboard.
Operations: The functions for each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) first validate the inputs, check for invalid values, and then perform the calculation if valid.
Input Validation: If an input is invalid (not a number), a warning message is displayed.
Shaking Effect: If there’s an invalid input or an attempt to divide by zero, the calculator shakes to alert the user.
Example of Operations:
Addition:
Enter 3 and 5, then click the + button. The result will be 8.

Division by Zero:
Enter 10 and 0, then click the / button. A warning message will show: Cannot divide by zero^.
