## New Learnings 📚

Building this Weather App taught me the exciting world of **APIs**! I learned how to send requests to external services, how to handle responses asynchronously, and how to deal with errors gracefully. 🌟 Dealing with real-time data and ensuring everything is displayed correctly was both challenging and rewarding. Each city search felt like an adventure as I connected to new data sources across the globe. 🌏
