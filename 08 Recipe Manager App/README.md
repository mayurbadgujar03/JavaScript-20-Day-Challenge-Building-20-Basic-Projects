# 🍴 Recipe Manager App 🍽️

## 📜 The Tale of a Kitchen Hero 👩‍🍳

Once upon a time in a cozy kitchen, there was a loving mother—my mummy—who spent countless hours cooking delicious meals for our family. From hearty stews to scrumptious desserts, her culinary skills knew no bounds. But there was a small problem... every time she wanted to prepare a dish, she would rummage through piles of handwritten recipes, sticky notes, and old cookbooks. Recipes were lost, ingredients were forgotten, and the magic of her kitchen felt chaotic. 😩📚

One day, while cleaning the kitchen after a hearty family meal, she sighed, "I wish there was a way to organize all these recipes in one place!" 

That's when the idea struck me—a simple, user-friendly app that would allow her to store, organize, and access her recipes with ease. And so, the **Recipe Manager App** was born! 🥳🍲
