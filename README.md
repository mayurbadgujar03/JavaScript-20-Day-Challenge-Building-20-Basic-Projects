Welcome to my 20-day JavaScript challenge! Over the course of 20 days, I am building 20 different basic JavaScript projects to improve my skills and deepen my understanding of fundamental web development concepts.
Each day, I will create a new project that covers various aspects of JavaScript, from simple DOM manipulation to more complex algorithms and interactive features. The goal of this challenge is to enhance my coding proficiency, experiment with new techniques, and explore the versatility of JavaScript in a practical way.

Day 1: Simple Calculator <br>
Day 2: Guess the Number Game <br>
Day 3: Temperature Converter<br>
