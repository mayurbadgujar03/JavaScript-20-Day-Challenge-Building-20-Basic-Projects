# Shape Drawer 🎨✏️

## 🌟 **A Journey of Creativity and Struggles**

The **Shape Drawer** started as a simple idea — a tool to let you draw shapes, customize their colors and sizes, and place them anywhere on the canvas. However, the journey was filled with obstacles, technical challenges, and lots of debugging.

### 💥 **Challenges Faced**
- **Toolbar at the Top**: We struggled with making the toolbar stay fixed above the canvas.
- **Click Locations**: Adjusting the click coordinates on the canvas took a lot of trial and error.
- **Canvas Size**: Ensuring that the canvas dimensions and drawing interactions worked well together was tricky.

Despite these hurdles, we prevailed, and **Shape Drawer** came to life, fully functional, with a fixed toolbar and a beautiful interface!
